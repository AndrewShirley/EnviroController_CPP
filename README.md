# EnviroController_CPP

This project is a C++ based environment controller. It uses an ESP32 Microprocessor, BME280 environment sensor, OLED display and a 4-channel SSR relay to monitor and control the environment, keeping it with a certain humidity and temperature.

It is monitored through MQTT using any MQTT client such as NodeRed.  See below for a screen shot of my own setup.

For this project, I also started to write a GUI library for monochrome OLED devices, compatible with Adafruit's pre-existing graphics library.
